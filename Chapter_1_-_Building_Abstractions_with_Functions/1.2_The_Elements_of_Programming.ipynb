    "A programming language is more than just a means for instructing a computer to perform tasks. The language also serves as a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes. Programs serve to communicate those ideas among the members of a programming community. Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:\n",
    "- __primitive expressions and statements__, which represent the simplest building blocks that the language provides,\n",
    "- __means of combination__, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and\n",
    "- __means of abstraction__, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: functions and data. (Soon we will discover that they are really not so distinct.) Informally, data is stuff that we want to manipulate, and functions describe the rules for manipulating the data. Thus, any powerful programming language should be able to describe primitive data and primitive functions and should have methods for combining and abstracting both functions and data."

Recall from algebra that the mathematical notion of a function is a mapping from some input arguments to an output value. For instance, the `max` function maps its inputs to a single output, which is the largest of the inputs. A function in Python is more than just an input-output mapping; it describes a computational process. However, the way in which Python expresses function application is the same as in mathematics."
